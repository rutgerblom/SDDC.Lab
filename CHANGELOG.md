# Changelog

## Dev-v3.0.0 16-MARCH-2021

### Added by Luis

- Changed Lab-Routers area from 666 to 0 (i.e. Backbone area) to facilitate sharing of routes between sites if NSX-T is reconfigured to use OSPF versus eBGP.
  This reconfiguration to use OSPF is not supported by automation, and would have to be done manually afterwards by the user.

## Dev-v3.0.0 31-MARCH-2021

### Added by Luis

- Commented Flash/HHD drive type configuration in ESXi kickstart templates.  Implemented Flash/HDD configuration in custom Ansible module called set_drive_type.  This was needed to support ESXi v7.0 Update 2.
- Updated NSX-T Ansible modules to latest versions found in VMware's NSX-T repository in GitHub.
- Added "SetAsDefault" option for NSX-T TransportZones.  When set to "True", the Transport Zone is set as "Default".
- Added "SetAsDefault" option to existing TransportZones in sample_config.yml file.
- Modified RAM configuration for Nested_ESXi hosts.  Changed all clusters to use 16GB RAM per host.
- Updated sample_config.yml to use the latest versions of ESXi (v7.0U2), NSX-T (v3.1.1), and vRLI (v8.3.0).
- Corrected issue with license_vSphere.yml module where it would fail if a product didn't have licenses.

## Dev-v3.0.0 02-APRIL-2021

### Added by Rutger

## Dev-v3.0.0 06-APRIL-2021

### Added by Luis

- Added support for eBGP peering with physical Layer-3 Lab-Router, and it is currently ALWAYS enabled.  This functionality may change in the future, especially while in a 'dev' branch.  That said, keep a close eye out for changes around this feature.
- Both IPv4 and IPv6 peering implemented.
- Modified config_sample.yml configuration.
- Added flags to control the origination of Default Routes to eBGP Peers
- Corrected filename used for Pod-Router configuration during deployment
- Added "mtu 1500" statement to Eth0 in Pod-Router configuration
- Corrected type-O in config_sample.yml file
- Default ASN Values are as follows:
  - Lab-Router ASN is 65000
  - Pod-Router ASN is 65000 + Pod.Network
  - NSX-T EdgeVMs ASN is 65000 + Pod.Network + 1

## Dev-v3.0.0 07-APRIL-2021

### Added by Luis

- Changes have been made to the config_sample.yml configuration file with this change.
- Added additional options to Nested_Router.Protocol variable.  Valid options are now "Static", "OSPF", "BGP", and "BOTH" (BGP and OSPF).  This determines the routing protocol(s) used by the Pod-Router into the Lab-Routers network segment (i.e. North Bound).
- Within Nested_Router, the Neighboring BGP routers are now broken up into two (2) sections: Routers and NSXEdges.  Each of these sections are a list, so you can add additional neighbors to fit your needs.  The "Routers" list of bgp neighbors is only instantiated when Nested_Router.Protocol == BGP or BOTH.  The "NSXEdges" is always instantiated when a dynamic routing protocol is chosen.
- Changed the Nested_Router.Protocol value in config_sample.yml from OSPF to BOTH.

## Dev-v3.0.0 10-APRIL-2021

- Added new Deploy.Software.Option.UnmountISO variable, which controls if ISOs are unmounted during the deployment process.  Be sure to read comments for that new option.
- TargetConfig.ISOMount is now the base location where all ISOs are now mounted.  Individual ISOs are mounted in subdirectories below this location in the form of: Vendor_Product_Version.  So, vCenter would be: VMware_vCenter_7.00U2
- Converted all modules which mount ISOs to this new ISO mounting scheme.
- Pod_Config.j2 template modified to support the new variable

## Dev-v4.0.0 27-JUNE-2021

### Added by Luis Chanu

  - VyOS Ansible modules requires the "Paramiko" module, so please be sure to use PIP3 to install it.  The README.md has been updated to now include this module as a requirement.
  - Due to SSH authentication failure with VyOS module, added "host_key_checking = false" to ansible.cfg file to permit SSH connections to succeed without first importing the hash.
  - Changes to VyOS router playbooks
    - Module deployRouter.yml now not only deploys the VyOS router, but also performs basic configuration (Name, Eth0 IP Address, Floating default route, enable SSH).
    - Due to changing syntax of the VyOS "/config/config.boot" file with newer versions of VyOS, instead of creating that file and copying it to the VyOS router (as was previously done), we now develop the individual VyOS "SET" commands for the target configuration, then send those commands to the provisioned VyOS router.  Once that's done, we then 'commit' and 'save' the configuration.  The creation of the VyOS router configuration is performed by the new configureRouter.yml playbook.
    - Added a pre-login message that shows the VyOS router name, along with a reminder that the login username is "vyos".
    - As a precaution, previous "deployRouter.yml" and "vyos_router.j2" files have been renamed to *_OLD, respectively.  They will be removed once the new VyOS router deployment has been throughly tested.

## Dev-v4.0.0 08-JULY-2021

### Added by Luis Chanu

  - Added a data structure for Nested_Router UserDefined commands to config_sample.yml
  - Added the ability for users to modify the VyOS Pod-Router configuration after it's deployed and the Pod baseline configuration is applied.  Users put the commands they want to be applied in a special file.  By default (configured in Nested_Router.UserConfig), the Pod specific router user configuration file is placed in the user's home directory, and is called "{{ SiteCode }}-Router-UserConfig.j2".  So, for example, for Pod #10, the file would be called "Pod-010-Router-UserConfig.j2".  This file is a Jinja2 template, so users can also utilize all the templating power of Jinja2 to generate their commands.

## Dev-v4.0.0 18-JULY-2021

### Added by Rutger Blom

  - Added the vSphere with Tanzu Workload Management playbooks to the deployment playbook.  Automated deployment of Workload Management is controlled in "config.yml" at "Deploy.Product.Tanzu.WorkloadManagement".  The default setting is "false" meaning that vSphere with Tanzu Workload Management is not deployed by default.
  - DNS forwarding is configured on the VyOS router's "VMNetwork" VLAN interface if "Deploy.Product.Tanzu.WorkloadManagement" is set to "true".
  - NSX-T is required for vSphere with Tanzu Workload Management (in this project) and as such conditionals have been added to the vSphere with Tanzu Workload Management playbooks that check whether NSX-T is deployed.

## Dev-v4.0.0 25-JULY-2021

### Added by Luis Chanu

  - Enabled OSPFv2 on Pod-Router NSX-T Edge facing interfaces (NSXEdgeUplink1 and NSXEdgeUplink2).
  - Moved OSPFv2 area configuration information below interface sections in Nested_Router.
  - OSPFv2 configuration was not added to NSX-T's Tier-0 Gateway within the configuration file.  If the user wants to configure OSPFv2 within NSX-T, they will have to do it manually.  There are currently no plans to add OSPFv2 configuration to the SDDC.Lab project given BGP is fully functional, supports IPv6, and is the protocol used by Federation.

### Added by Luis Chanu
  - As the sample_config.yml file has changed over time, the amount of time it takes for createPodConfig.yml to complete is increasing.  Latest testing shows it's now taking just over 2 hours to complete.  You can run multiple in parallel without issue.  We are looking into this, but for now, that's how long to expect.
  - Updated verbiage in createPodConfig.yml on how long it takes to create the static Pod-XXX-Config.yml file.
  - Added Deploy.Product.NSXT.GlobalManager.PodNumber variable to support Federation, as a stretched Tier-0 uses the same ASN across all sites.

    - Fed-Z where Z is either Y or N, and indicates whether the Pod Configuration has NSX-T Federation deployment enabled or not

## Dev-v4.0.0 24-DEC-2021

### Added by Luis Chanu
  - **IMPORTANT**: As part of NSX-T Federation, NSX-T v3.2.0 appears to not support importing objects from a Location into the Global Manager.  For this reason, SDDC.Lab can not be used to deploy Federation when deploying NSX-T v3.2.0, as SDDC.Lab utilizes this functionality.  The workaround to this is to deploy Federation using NSX-T v3.1.3.3, then manually upgrade the Pods to v3.2.0.  It's assumed that this functionality will be re-introduced in a later release.  Standalone (i.e. Non-Federated) deployments of NSX-T v3.2.0 has been tested, and works fine.
  - NSX-T v3.2.0 Federation details added to README.md file
  - NSX-T v3.2.0 takes MUCH longer to set the "password_change_frequency" on an Edge Transport Node users than it did under NSX-T v3.1.3.3.  For this reason, the timeout on the task that performs this operation within "createNsxEdgeTn.yml" playbook has been increased from 15 to 60 seconds.
  - NSX-T Version Tested Status:
    - v3.1.3.3: Standalone and Federation
    - v3.1.3.5: We are still looking into an issue when deploying against this version.  Until further testing has been done, please do not deploy directly to this version...use v3.1.3.3 instead, then manually upgrade to v3.1.3.5.
    - v3.2.0:   Standalone only (See 'IMPORTANT' comment above)
  - Manually edited Ansible module "nsxt_fabric_compute_managers.py" to incorporate a change that was made in the VMware NSX-T Ansible modules to support Compute Manager registartion under NSX-T v3.2.0.
  - The "var_NSXT_EdgeTransportNodes.j2" template has been updated to support v3.2.0.  These changes have also been tested against v3.1.3.3, and deployed fine.
  - Modified "createPodConfig.yml" to append the Global Manager Pod to the end of the filename if Federation is enabled.
  - The following playbooks have been modified to support NSX-T v3.2.0:
    - createNsxEdgeTn.yml
    - createNsxTz.yml

## Dev-v4.0.0 25-DEC-2021

### Added by Luis Chanu
  - Increased retry count on vSphere Replication partner in checkVcReplicaionPartner.yml from 30 to 45.  This is to ensure very large deployments don't timeout during deployment.  Have not run into any issues, just a preventative measure.
  - The following deployment scenarios completed successfully:
    - VCSA v7.00U3A, ESXi 7.00U3, NSX-T v3.1.3.3 (2-Site Federation)
    - VCSA v7.00U3A, ESXi 7.00U3, NSX-T v3.1.3.5 (Standalone)
  - The following deployment scenarios **FAILED**:
    - VCSA v7.00U3A, ESXi 7.00U3, NSX-T v3.2.0   (Standalone) -- Issue with EdgeVM state changes when password aging is cleared (Flaps from SUCCESS to IN_PROGRESS), then Edge Cluster creation fails.

## Dev-v4.0.0 26-DEC-2021

### Added by Luis Chanu
  - Modified createNsxEdgeCluster.yml play to address the flapping of EdgeVM state when the user password aging is disabled.
  - The following deployment scenarios completed successfully:
    - VCSA v7.00U3A, ESXi 7.00U3, NSX-T v3.1.3.3 (2-Site Federation)
    - VCSA v7.00U3A, ESXi 7.00U3, NSX-T v3.1.3.5 (Standalone)

  - The following files were updated so please update your non-sample files:
    - config_sample.yml

## Dev-v4.0.0 28-DEC-2021

### Added by Luis Chanu
  - Following changes were made to createNsxEdgeTn.yml playbook:
    - The nested loop to set password aging to 0 was reversed so that each of the EdgeVMs are cycled through for each user.  This permits the EdgeVM to "recover" to the "SUCCESS" state before the next REST API call is attempted to it.
    - Added an additional check at the end of the playbook to verify all EdgeVMs are in a "SUCCESS" state before the playbook is completed.  This hopefully ensures all EdgeVMs are ready for other REST API calls.

## Dev-v4.0.0 29-DEC-2021

### Added by Luis Chanu
  - The SDDC.Lab project was migrated from older local Ansible NSX-T modules to [VMware Ansible modules for NSX-T v3.2.0](https://github.com/vmware/ansible-for-nsxt/tree/v3.2.0).  In order to migrate your installation, follow these steps:
    - Install VMware Ansible for NSX-T Modules (run BOTH commands):
      - ansible-galaxy collection install git+https://github.com/vmware/ansible-for-nsxt.git,v3.2.0

      - library = library
      - module_utils = module_utils
    - Within the "library" directory, delete all files that begin with "nsxt_" except for the ones listed below.  The following files should remain:
      - __Module_Info (This file has been updated, so obtain the updated file from the project)
      - claim_vsan_disks.py

  - To leverage [TinyVM](https://github.com/luischanu/TinyVM), but sure to add it to ```SDDC.Lab Content Library``` on the physical vCenter Server, then sync the VM Template to your SDDC.Lab Pods.
  - Corrected Table of Content entries to work correctly in ```README.md``` file.
  - Added instructions to ```README.md``` regarding [TinyVM](https://github.com/luischanu/TinyVM) and how to enable the deployment of Test Workload VMs.
  - As ```config_sample.yml``` was modified, please update your config files accordingly.
