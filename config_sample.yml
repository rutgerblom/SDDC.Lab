## Users need to modify the following 'WorkloadVMs' section to meet their environment, as this is just a sample.
## The VM and OVF Templates must be located in the Pod's Content Library.  It's suggested that the
## Pod's Content Library subscribe to a Content Library that exists on the Physical vCenter Server, which
## the Pod can then automatically subscribe to as part of it's deployment.  The user can then centrally place
## all of the VM/OVF Templates in the Content Library of the Physical vCenter Server.
