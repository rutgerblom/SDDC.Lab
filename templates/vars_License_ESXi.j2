 #     Filename: templates/vars_License_ESXi.j2
 #      Used By: This file is used by the playbook addLicenses.yml
 #      Purpose: This Jinja2 template file is used to create a list hosts and the accompanying license which should be assigned to it.
 #               This script actually tracks license socket usage, and will consume use the same license until available sockets remaining
 #               on the license isn't sufficient.  At that point, it will use the next license, and so on.
 #
 #    Important: This file uses the 'do' feature of Jinja.  In order for this to function, the following lines need to be included in the
 #               ansible.cfg file:
 #                                   [defaults]
 #                                   jinja2_extensions = jinja2.ext.do,jinja2.ext.i18n
